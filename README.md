22/12 note: I think I accidentally broke the whole entire thing... Whenever I try to run the program in VSC, I get a constant infinite output from a warning message use case that's only supposed to activate once in the case of a user inputting the wrong data type. Try it yourself if you don't believe me lol
Trying 2 code a working text (yet graphical) version of trips traps trull...
26/12 note: I finally got it working! The biggest problems were created by my lack of logical workflow and indentation, i.e. I was telling the program to execute/call a function or variable that I hadn't yet defined.
